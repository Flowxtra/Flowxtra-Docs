# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Flowxtra supports the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, allowing AI agents (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) to securely interact with your recruitment data.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open standard that enables AI assistants to connect to external data sources and tools. By running a Flowxtra MCP Server, you can ask your AI to:
- "Summarize the latest applications for the Senior Engineer role"
- "Draft rejection emails for these 5 candidates"
- "Analyze salary trends across my posted jobs"

## Getting Started

To use Flowxtra with MCP, you need:
1. A Flowxtra **API Key**
2. An MCP Client (e.g., Claude Desktop App)
3. The Flowxtra MCP Server (via Node.js or Docker)

## Server Configuration

Run the official Flowxtra MCP server:

```bash
npx -y @flowxtra/mcp-server
```

You will be prompted to enter your API Key.
