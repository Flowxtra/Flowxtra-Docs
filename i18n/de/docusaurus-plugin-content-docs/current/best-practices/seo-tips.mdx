# SEO Tips for Career Pages

Drive organic traffic to your Flowxtra career page.

## Keywords
- Include the **Job Title** and **Location** in the first paragraph.
- Mention specific skills (e.g., "Python", "Salesforce") that candidates search for.

## Metadata
Flowxtra handles technical SEO, but you control the content:
- **Title Tag**: Auto-generated as `Job Title | Company Name`.
- **Meta Description**: First 160 characters of your job description. Make them count!

## Backlinks
- Link to your careers page from your main company website footer.
- Share links on LinkedIn and social media to generate social signals.
- Ask employees to share links.

## URL Structure
Flowxtra uses clean URLs:
`yourcompany.apply-link.net/jobs/senior-engineer-london`
Avoid changing job titles frequently, as it may change the URL and break old links.
