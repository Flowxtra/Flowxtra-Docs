# Webhooks

Webhooks allow Flowxtra to notify your external systems when events happen.

## Supported Events

- `job.created`
- `job.published`
- `application.created` (New candidate applied)
- `application.status_updated`
- `candidate.hired`

## Payload Example

When an `application.created` event triggers, your endpoint receives:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_123",
  "type": "application.created",
  "created_at": "2023-10-01T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "application_id": "app_987",
    "job_id": "job_123",
    "candidate": {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "email": "jane@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security

Verify webhook signatures using the `X-Flowxtra-Signature` header to ensure requests are genuinely from Flowxtra.
