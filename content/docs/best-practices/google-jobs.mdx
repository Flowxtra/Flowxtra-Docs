# Google for Jobs Optimization

Flowxtra automatically adds `JobPosting` schema markup to your posts, but content quality determines ranking.

## Required Fields for Ranking

Google prioritizes jobs that have:
1. **Valid Location**: Complete address or "Remote".
2. **Salary Info**: BaseSalary numeric values.
3. **Employment Type**: Full-time, part-time, etc.
4. **Date Posted**: Fresh content ranks higher.

## Common Issues

### Why isn't my job showing up?
- **Delay**: Google takes 24-48 hours to index new pages.
- **Incomplete Address**: Ensure "City, State, Country" is accurate.
- **Expired**: Closed jobs drop off immediately.

## Tips
- Keep the **Job Title** standard. Google matches "Software Engineer" better than "Code Wizard".
- Don't spam keywords in the title.
- Ensure your logo is uploaded in Settings (Google displays this).
