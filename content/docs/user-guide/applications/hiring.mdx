# Hiring & Offers

The final (and best) stage of usage Flowxtra!

## Extending an Offer

While Flowxtra doesn't currently generate legal contracts, it helps manage the offer process.

1. Move candidate to **Offer** stage
2. Send your offer letter via email (or attach a PDF)
3. Record the offer details in **Notes** (Salary, Start Date) for your records

## Marking as Hired

When a candidate accepts:
1. Drag them to the **Hired** column
2. **Confetti Time!** 🎉
3. You will be prompted to:
   - **Close the Job**: If this was the only opening.
   - **Keep Open**: If you are hiring multiple people for this role.
   - **Reject Others**: Bulk reject remaining candidates (optional).

## Hired Analytics

Marking candidates as Hired populates your "Time to Hire" and "Source Quality" reports, helping you understand:
- Which job boards bring the best employees?
- How long does your process take?
- Where are your bottlenecks?

**Data Retention**: Hired candidate profiles are stored securely. You can export their data to your HRIS or Payroll system using CSV export.
