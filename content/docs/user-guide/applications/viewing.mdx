# Viewing Applications

The **Applications Dashboard** gives you a bird's-eye view of your candidate pipeline.

## Accessing Applications

You can access applications in two ways:

1. **Global View**: Click **Applications** in the sidebar to see *all* candidates across *all* jobs.
2. **Job View**: Click on a specific job in the **Jobs Dashboard** to see only candidates for that role.

## The Kanban Board

Flowxtra uses a visual Kanban board to track candidates through stages.

### Default Columns
- **New**: Just applied, not yet reviewed
- **Screening**: Under initial review
- **Interview**: Scheduled for interview
- **Offer**: Offer extended
- **Hired**: Accepted offer
- **Rejected**: Not moving forward

### Drag and Drop
Move candidates between stages by simply dragging their card from one column to another.

## List View

If you prefer a table format, switch to **List View** using the toggle in the top right.
- Useful for bulk actions
- Sort by date, name, or rating
- precise filtering

## Candidate Card

Each card on the board shows quick info:
- Candidate Name
- Applied Date
- Rating (1-5 stars)
- Current Job Title (from resume)
- Source (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed)

## Candidate Profile

Click on a candidate card to open their full profile.

### Profile Sections
