# Job Widget

The Job Widget allows you to display Flowxtra job listings directly on your own company website, seamlessly integrated with your brand.

## What is the Job Widget?

It's a small piece of code you copy and paste into your website builder (WordPress, Webflow, WiX, Squarespace, or custom HTML). It automatically:
- Lists all your active jobs
- Updates instantly when you post/close jobs
- Redirects candidates to the application form
- Matches your website's width and responsive design

## How to Set Up

1. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Job Widget**
2. **Configure Appearance**:
   - **Theme**: Light or Dark
   - **Color**: Choose your brand color (Hex code) to match buttons and links
   - **Font**: Select a font family that matches your site
3. **Copy Code**: Click **Copy Snippet**
4. **Paste**: Insert the code into your website's HTML where you want the jobs to appear.

### HTML Example

```html
<div id="flowxtra-jobs"></div>
<script src="https://embed.flowxtra.com/widget.js" data-company="YOUR_COMPANY_ID"></script>
```

## Customization (Advanced)

Developers can further customize the widget using CSS. The widget renders standard HTML elements with specific classes like `.flowxtra-job-card`, `.flowxtra-title`, etc.

```css
/* Example Custom CSS */
.flowxtra-job-card {
  border: 1px solid #eee;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```
