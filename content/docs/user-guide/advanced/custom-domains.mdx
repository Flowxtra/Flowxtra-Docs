# Custom Domains

By default, your public career page lives at `flowxtra.com/companies/your-company`. With Custom Domains, you can host it at `careers.yourcompany.com` or `jobs.yourcompany.com`.

## Benefits
- **Branding**: Looks more professional and trustworthy.
- **SEO**: Traffic builds authority for *your* domain, not ours.
- **Tracking**: Easier to verify tracking pixels.

## Requirements
- Access to your domain's DNS settings (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.)
- A **Business** or **Enterprise** subscription plan.

## Setup Instructions

<Callout type="warn">
DNS changes can take up to 24-48 hours to propagate globally.
</Callout>

1. **In Flowxtra Dashboard**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Custom Domain**
   - Enter your desired subdomain (e.g., `careers.yourcompany.com`)
   - Click **Connect**

2. **In Your Domain Provider**:
   - Create a new **CNAME Record**
   - **Host/Name**: `careers` (or whatever subdomain you chose)
   - **Value/Target**: `custom.flowxtra.com`
   - **TTL**: Auto or 3600

3. **Verify**:
   - Go back to Flowxtra Settings
   - Click **Verify Connection**
   - Once verified, Flowxtra will automatically provision an SSL certificate (HTTPS) for your new domain.

## SSL / HTTPS
We automatically generate and renew Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for all custom domains. Your career page will always be secure.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Not Secure" Warning**: The SSL certificate is generating. Wait 15 minutes and refresh.
- **404 Error**: DNS hasn't propagated yet. Wait a few hours.
- **Invalid Record**: Check for typos in the CNAME value. It must be `custom.flowxtra.com`, not your own URL.
