# Managing Jobs

The **Jobs Dashboard** is your central hub for tracking and managing all your recruitment efforts.

## The Jobs Dashboard

Navigate to **Jobs** in the main menu to see a list of all your postings.

### Columns
- **Title**: Job title and ID
- **Status**: Active, Paused, Closed, Draft
- **Views**: Total number of page views
- **Applications**: Number of received applications
- **Posted Date**: When the job went live
- **Location**: Work location

### Filtering and Search
Use the search bar to find jobs by title. Use the status tabs to filter by:
- **Active**: Currently live jobs
- **Drafts**: Jobs in progress
- **Closed**: Past positions

## Editing a Job

You can edit a job at any time, even if it's live.

1. Find the job in the dashboard
2. Click the **Edit** (pencil) icon
3. Make your changes
4. Click **Update Job**

<Callout type="warn">
**Caution**: Changing key details like the "Job Title" or "Location" of a live job may reset its SEO ranking on Google. For minor typos, it's fine. For major changes, consider closing the job and creating a new one.
</Callout>

## Closing a Job

When you have found your hire or want to stop receiving applications:

1. Click the **More Options** (three dots) menu
2. Select **Close Job**
3. Confirm the action

**Effect**:
- The public job page will show "Position Filled" or "No longer accepting applications"
- Candidates can no longer apply
- The job moves to the "Closed" tab

## Reopening a Job

If a hire falls through or you need another person for the same role:

1. Go to the **Closed** tab
2. Find the job
3. Select **Revert to Draft** or **Republish**
4. Review details and publish again

## Deleting a Job

**Deletion is permanent.** It removes the job posting and disassociates it from applications (though candidate data may be preserved depending on settings).

1. Click **More Options**
2. Select **Delete**
3. Type "DELETE" to confirm

<Callout type="tip">
We recommend **Closing** jobs instead of **Deleting** them so you preserve the historical data and analytics.
