</Steps>

## Job Quality & Compliance Check

Flowxtra uses automated and manual review processes to ensure all job postings meet quality standards and comply with platform guidelines.

### Automated AI Review

All job postings are automatically scanned by AI to detect:

**Anti-Discrimination Compliance**:
- Age discrimination (e.g., "young dynamic team", "digital native")
- Gender bias (e.g., "salesman" instead of "salesperson")
- Racial or ethnic preferences
- Other protected characteristics (religion, disability, marital status)

**Content Quality**:
- Misleading job titles
- Spam or duplicate content
- Inappropriate language
- Missing essential information
- Unrealistic requirements
- Vague job descriptions

<Callout type="warn">
**Important**: If the AI detects discriminatory language or policy violations, your job posting will be **automatically rejected** without manual review. Make sure your content is inclusive and compliant before publishing.
</Callout>

### Manual Review for New Accounts

**Review Requirements**:
- **New companies** and **unverified accounts** may have their job postings manually reviewed
- This helps prevent spam and scam job postings
- Review typically takes 1 business day
- You'll receive an email notification once approved

**Fast-Track Approval**:
Companies with the following are usually approved faster:
- Registered commercial registration number
- Valid tax ID / VAT number
- Established market presence
- Verified company domain
- Complete company profile

<Callout type="info">
Once your company is verified and builds a good posting history, future jobs will be approved automatically without manual review.
</Callout>

### Compliance with Ad Quality Guidelines

All job postings must comply with [Flowxtra's Ad Quality Guidelines](https://flowxtra.com/en/ad-quality-guidelines).

**Key Requirements**:
1. **No Discrimination**: Jobs must not discriminate based on age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, or other protected characteristics
2. **Authentic Opportunities**: Only genuine, legal job opportunities are allowed
3. **Transparency**: Clear job titles, responsibilities, and company information

<Callout type="error">
**Serious Violations**: Accounts that repeatedly post discriminatory content, scams, or illegal job offers will be **permanently banned** without warning.
</Callout>

### Best Practices for Compliance

**Use Inclusive Language**:
- ✅ "Sales Representative" instead of ❌ "Salesman"
