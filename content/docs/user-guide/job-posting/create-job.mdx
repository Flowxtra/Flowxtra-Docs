# Creating a Job

Creating a job posting is the first step to finding your next great hire. Flowxtra's streamlined workflow guides you through every step of the process.

## The Job Creation Workflow

The job creation process consists of five main steps:

1. **Basic Info**: Title, location, and employment type
2. **Job Details**: Description, requirements, and responsibilities
3. **Salary & Benefits**: Compensation transparency
4. **Application Settings**: Screening questions and form configuration
5. **Review & Publish**: Final checks and SEO preview

## Starting a New Job

To start creating a job:

1. Log in to your Flowxtra dashboard
2. Click the **Create Job** button in the top right corner
3. OR navigate to **Jobs** and click **Post a Job**

<Callout type="info">
**Drafts are saved automatically.** If you leave the page, you can resume editing from the **Drafts** tab in the Jobs section.
</Callout>

## Copying an Existing Job

Save time by duplicating a previous job posting:

1. Go to the **Jobs** dashboard
2. Find the job you want to copy
3. Click the **More Options** (three dots) menu
