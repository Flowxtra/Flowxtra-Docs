## Job Statuses

- **Active**: Live and visible to the public.
- **Paused**: Hidden from public view, but link remains valid. Useful if you have too many applicants but aren't done hiring.
- **Closed**: Removed from public view. Applications are closed.
- **Draft**: Not yet published.

**SEO Note**: When you close a job, Flowxtra automatically adds "schema.org" metadata to tell Google the position is filled, preventing old listings from lingering in search results.
