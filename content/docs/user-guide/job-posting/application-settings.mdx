# Application Settings

Control how candidates apply and what information you collect.

## Application Method

Choose where candidates submit their application:

### 1. Flowxtra Hosted Form (Recommended)
Candidates apply directly on Flowxtra.
- **Pros**: All applications tracked in your dashboard, use screening questions, automated emails.
- **Cons**: None.

### 2. External URL
Redirect candidates to your own ATS or career site.
- **Pros**: Integrate with existing legacy systems.
- **Cons**: Flowxtra cannot track applicants, screening questions won't work, analytics will be limited to clicks only.

### 3. Email Application
Candidates send applications to a specific email address.
- **Pros**: Simple for very small teams.
- **Cons**: Hard to manage, requires manual data entry, no tracking.

## Configuring the Flowxtra Form

If you chose **Flowxtra Hosted Form**, you can customize the required fields:

- **Resume/CV**: Mandatory / Optional / Off
- **Cover Letter**: Mandatory / Optional / Off
- **Phone Number**: Mandatory / Optional / Off
- **LinkedIn Profile**: Mandatory / Optional / Off
- **Portfolio/Website**: Mandatory / Optional / Off
- **Photo**: Mandatory / Optional / Off

## Screening Questions

Filter candidates automatically by asking specific questions.

### Question Types
- **Yes/No**: "Are you authorized to work in the US?"
- **Multiple Choice**: "How many years of React experience do you have?" (0-1, 1-3, 3+)
- **Short Answer**: "What is your expected salary?"
- **Disqualifying Questions**: For Yes/No questions, you can auto-reject candidates who give the "wrong" answer.

### Adding a Question
1. Click **Add Question**
2. Select the type
3. Enter the question text
4. Define options (for multiple choice)
5. Set as **Required** if mandatory

<Callout type="tip">
Keep screening questions to a minimum (3-5 max). Too many questions can increase the drop-off rate.
</Callout>

## Auto-Reply Emails

Configure the automated email sent to candidates after they apply.

- **Subject**: e.g., "We received your application for [Job Title]"
- **Body**: Customize the message to thank them and explain the next steps.
- **Variables**: Use `{candidate_name}` and `{job_title}` to personalize the email.
