# Authentication

Secure your API requests using API Keys.

## Generating an API Key

1. Log in to Flowxtra as an **Owner** or **Admin**.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **API Keys**.
3. Click **Create New Key**.
4. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Zapier Integration", "Internal Dashboard").
5. Copy the key immediately. **You will not be shown this key again.**

<Callout type="warn">
Never expose your API key in client-side code (browsers, mobile apps). Always make requests from your secure backend server.
</Callout>

## Using the Key

Include the key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```http
GET /v1/jobs HTTP/1.1
Host: api.flowxtra.com
Authorization: Bearer fk_live_1234567890abcdef
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Revoking Keys

If a key is compromised:
1. Go to the API Keys dashboard.
2. Click **Revoke** next to the specific key.
3. Access will be immediately blocked for that key.
