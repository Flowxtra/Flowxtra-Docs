# Job Posting Best Practices

Writing a great job post is marketing. You are selling the role to the candidate.

## Structure Your Post

1. **The Hook**: Start with why the role specifically is exciting.
2. **The Company**: Brief mission statement.
3. **The Work**: What they will actually do (not just responsibilities).
4. **The Requirements**: Must-haves vs. Nice-to-haves.
5. **The Offer**: Salary, benefits, and perks.

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do
- Use "You" language ("You will build...", not "The candidate will build...").
- Be specific about technologies and tools.
- Highlight remote/hybrid flexibility early.

### Don't
- Don't use wall-of-text paragraphs. Use bullets.
- Don't use buzzwords ("Ninja", "Rockstar").
- Don't make the requirements list impossibly long.

**Tone of Voice**: Keep it professional but authentic. Avoid overly corporate jargon.
