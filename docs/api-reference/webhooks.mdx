# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to subscribe to real-time events in Flowxtra, such as new applications or status changes.

## Supported Events

| Event Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `application.created` | Triggered when a new application is received |
| `application.updated` | Triggered when an application status changes |
| `job.published` | Triggered when a job goes live |
| `candidate.hired` | Triggered when a candidate is marked as hired |

## Configuration

You can configure webhooks in your **Settings** > **Integrations** dashboard.

### Verification

Flowxtra sends a `X-Flowxtra-Signature` header with each request. You should verify this signature to ensure the request came from us.

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifySignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret);
  const digest = hmac.update(payload).digest('hex');
  return signature === digest;
}
```
