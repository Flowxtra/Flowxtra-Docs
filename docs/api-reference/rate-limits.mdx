# Rate Limits

To ensure the stability and fairness of our platform, the Flowxtra API imposes rate limits on requests.

## Limits

- **Standard API Key**: 60 requests per minute
- **Enterprise API Key**: 1,000 requests per minute

## Headers

We include rate limit details in the response headers of every request:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests you're permitted to make per minute.
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current time window.
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time at which the current rate limit window resets (in UTC epoch seconds).

## Exceeding Limits

If you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "message": "You have exceeded your request limit. Please try again later."
  }
}
```
