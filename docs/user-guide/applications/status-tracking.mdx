# Status Tracking

Learn how to customize and manage your hiring pipeline.

## Pipeline Stages

The pipeline defines the steps a candidate goes through. You can customize these stages to match your company's actual hiring process.

### Customizing Stages

1. Go to **Settings** > **Pipeline**
2. **Add Stage**: Create a new column (e.g., "Tech Assessment", "Culture Fit Interview")
3. **Reorder**: Drag stages to change their order
4. **Rename**: Edit existing stage names
5. **Delete**: Remove unused stages (cannot delete system stages like "New" or "Hired")

## Stage Automations

You can trigger actions when a candidate enters a stage:

- **Send Email**: Automatically send a "Thanks for applying" email when moving to "New".
- **Assign Team Member**: Assign the Head of Engineering when moving to "Tech Interview".
- **Request Info**: Send a questionnaire link when moving to "Screening".

### Setting up Automation

1. Click the **Gear Icon** on a pipeline column header
2. Select **Add Automation**
3. Choose the trigger and action

:::tip Best Practice
Don't automate rejection emails immediately upon moving a candidate to "Rejected". It's better to review and send them in batches or with a delay to maintain a human touch.
