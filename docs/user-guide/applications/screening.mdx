# Screening & Filtering

With many applications, efficiency is key. Use screening tools to find the best talent quickly.

## Filters

Use the filter bar to narrow down the candidate list:

- **Job**: Filter by specific listing
- **Status**: Show only "New" or "Interview" candidates
- **Rating**: Show only 4+ star candidates
- **Date Applied**: See recent applicants
- **Tags**: Filter by custom tags (e.g., "Referral", "Local")

## Evaluating Candidates

### Star Ratings

Rate candidates from 1 to 5 stars.

- Ratings are visible to your team but **hidden from the candidate**.
- Use ratings to sort the best candidates to the top.

### Internal Notes

Add comments to a candidate's profile to discuss with your team.

- "@Mention" team members to notify them.
- Notes are strictly internal.

### Tagging

Add custom labels to candidates for organization:

- *Strong Technical Skills*
- *Needs Relocation*
- *Referral*
- *Future Potential*

## Disqualifying Candidates

### Manual Rejection

1. Move candidate to **Rejected** column
2. OR click **Reject** on their profile
3. (Optional) Choose a rejection reason for your analytics (e.g., "Lack of experience", "Salary mismatch").

### Bulk Actions

In **List View**:

1. Select multiple candidates
2. Click **Reject Selected**
3. Choose whether to send a rejection email (highly recommended for good employer branding).

:::tip Rejection Emails
You can set a delay (e.g., 2 days) so rejection emails aren't sent instantly, which can feel impersonal.
