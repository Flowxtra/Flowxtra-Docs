# Communication

Keep candidates engaged with built-in messaging features.

## Email Integration

Flowxtra syncs with email so you can message candidates without leaving the dashboard.

### Sending an Email

1. Open a candidate profile
2. Click the **Email** tab
3. Type your message or select a **Template**
4. Click **Send**

The candidate receives the email in their normal inbox. When they reply, it appears in Flowxtra AND your email inbox (if connected).

## Email Templates

Save time with standardized responses.

### Creating Templates

Go to **Settings** > **Email Templates** to create:

- Interview Requests
- Rejection letters
- Offer letters
- "More Info Needed" requests

### Using Variables

Personalize templates automatically:

- `{first_name}`
- `{job_title}`
- `{company_name}`

## Scheduling Interviews

### Manual Scheduling

Send an email proposing times.

### Calendar Integration (Coming Soon)

Connect Google Calendar or Outlook to allow candidates to book available slots directly.

## Bulk Messaging

Need to update multiple candidates?

1. Go to **List View**
2. Select candidates
3. Click **Email Selected**
4. Choose a template (e.g., "Sorry, the position has been filled")
5. Send

:::info Privacy
