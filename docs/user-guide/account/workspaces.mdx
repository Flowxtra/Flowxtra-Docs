# Workspaces Guide

Workspaces in Flowxtra allow you to manage multiple companies or brands under a single account, with complete isolation of data and settings.

## 1. What are Workspaces?

A Workspace is an independent environment within your account that represents a single company or brand. Each workspace has:

**Global Application Link**:
- Such as `your-brand.apply-jobs.net` or `your-brand.bewerben.link`
- Used as a unique, branded address to access the workspace
- Selected from 7 market-specific domains

**Independent Settings**:
- Company-specific logo
- Brand colors
- Company data and information

**Separate Database**:
- Candidates and jobs don't mix between workspaces
- Complete data isolation between different workspaces

<Callout type="info">
Workspaces are ideal for companies managing multiple brands, recruitment agencies serving multiple clients, or companies with independent branches.
</Callout>

## 2. Accessing Workspaces

To access workspace management:

1. Navigate to **Settings** from the main menu
2. Select **Workspaces**
3. You'll see a list of all workspaces available to your account

On this page, you can:
- View all your workspaces
- Switch between different workspaces
- Create new workspaces
- Delete unused workspaces

## 3. Creating a New Workspace

<Callout type="warning">
**Workspace Limit**: The number of available workspaces depends on your current plan:

- **Free Plan**: Only one workspace
- **Starter Plan and above**: Multiple workspaces

If you've reached the limit, you'll need to upgrade to a higher plan.
</Callout>

### Steps

1. From the **Workspaces** page, click the **"Create Workspace"** button
2. If you've reached the limit, you'll see an option to upgrade to a higher plan
3. Enter the new company information:

**Required Information**:
- **Company Name**: The legal or trade name of the company
- **Application Link**: Choose a market-specific domain (e.g., `apply-jobs.net`) and define your company path/name.
- **Website**: Optional - company website URL
- **City**: Optional - headquarters location

4. Click **"Create"** to create the workspace

<Callout type="tip">
**Tip**: Choose a clear and memorable name for your link, as it will be used by your team and candidates to access jobs.
</Callout>

### Application Link Requirements

When choosing your link:
- **Unique**: The combination of `name` + `domain` must be unique.
- **Format**: Only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.
- **Selection**: Cannot be changed after creation.

**Valid Examples**:
- ✅ `tech-solutions` + `apply-jobs.net` → `https://tech-solutions.apply-jobs.net`
- ✅ `acme-gmbh` + `bewerben.link` → `https://acme-gmbh.bewerben.link`
- ✅ `paris-branch` + `appliquer.net` → `https://paris-branch.appliquer.net`

**Invalid Examples**:
- ❌ `Tech-Solutions` → Not allowed (uppercase letters)
- ❌ `-acme-` → Not allowed (starts/ends with hyphen)
- ❌ `acme corp` → Not allowed (spaces)
- ❌ `acme.flowxtra.com` → Not allowed (subdomains no longer supported)

## 4. Switching Between Workspaces

To switch the active workspace:

1. From the **Workspaces** page, find the workspace you want to switch to
2. Click the **"Switch"** button next to the workspace name
3. You'll be redirected to your dashboard for that workspace
4. After logging in (if required), you'll be in the new workspace

<Callout type="info">
**Note**: The currently active workspace is marked with **"Active"** and cannot be switched to again (because you're already in it).
</Callout>

### What Happens When Switching

When switching to a different workspace:
- You're logged out of the current workspace session
- You access the data isolated for that specific workspace
- You need to log in again if the session is not shared
- You'll only see data and jobs from the new workspace

## 5. Deleting a Workspace

You can delete any inactive workspace:

1. From the **Workspaces** page, click the **"Delete"** button next to the workspace you want to delete
2. Confirm deletion in the popup window
3. Read the warnings carefully before confirming

<Callout type="danger">
**Important Warning**: Deletion cannot be undone!

When you delete a workspace, **all associated data** will be permanently deleted:
- All published jobs
- All candidates and applications
- Settings and customizations
- Company and team data

**This data cannot be recovered after deletion.**
</Callout>

### Deletion Restrictions

- **Cannot delete the currently active workspace**: You must switch to another workspace first
- **Deletion must be confirmed**: To protect against accidental deletion
- **Deletion is immediate**: There is no grace period or recovery option

<Callout type="tip">
**Tip**: Before deleting a workspace, make sure to:
- Export any important data
- Close all active jobs
- Notify team members
- Transfer any necessary information to another workspace
</Callout>

## Common Use Cases

### For Multi-Brand Companies

If your company manages multiple brands:
- Create a separate workspace for each brand
- Maintain independent identity for each brand (logo, colors, domain)
- Manage recruitment for each brand separately

### For Recruitment Agencies

If you're a recruitment agency serving multiple clients:
- Create a workspace for each client
- Keep each client's data separate and protected
- Provide customized reports for each client

### For Companies with Independent Branches

If you have branches in different cities or countries:
- Create a workspace for each branch
- Give each branch autonomy in recruitment
- Maintain unified standards across all branches

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I transfer data between workspaces?

Currently, there is no automatic option to transfer data between workspaces. If you need to transfer data, contact the support team at `support@flowxtra.com`.

### Can I change the application link after creation?

The application link cannot be changed after creating the workspace. If you need to change it, you'll need to create a new workspace and manually transfer the data.

It depends on your plan:
- **Free Plan**: One workspace
- **Starter Plan**: Up to 3 workspaces

Yes, each workspace is billed separately. See the [Subscription & Billing](/user-guide/account/subscription-billing) page for more details.
