# Basic Concepts

Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you make the most of Flowxtra's features and capabilities.

## Core Terminology

### Job Posting

A **job posting** (or job listing) is a published advertisement for an open position at your company. Each job posting includes:

- Job title and description
- Requirements and qualifications
- Salary and benefits information
- Application instructions
- Employment details (type, location, schedule)

Job postings can be in different states:

- **Draft**: Not yet published, visible only to you
- **Published**: Live and accepting applications
- **Paused**: Temporarily not accepting applications
- **Closed**: No longer accepting applications
- **Archived**: Removed from active listings

### Application

An **application** is a candidate's submission for a specific job posting. Applications include:

- Candidate contact information
- Resume/CV
- Cover letter (if required)
- Answers to screening questions
- Application timestamp

### Candidate

A **candidate** is an individual who has applied for one or more positions at your company. Candidate profiles aggregate all their applications and interactions with your company.

### Pipeline

The **pipeline** represents the stages a candidate moves through during the hiring process:

1. **New**: Just submitted application
2. **Screening**: Under initial review
3. **Interview**: Scheduled or completed interviews
4. **Offer**: Job offer extended
5. **Hired**: Accepted offer
6. **Rejected**: Not moving forward
